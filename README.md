In this project I created a VHDL code to do a convolutional matrix operation.
This can be used in noise filtering for images. Initialize the coef matrix in the code with a noise reducer filter such as [1 1 1;1 1 1;1 1 1].
For being able to do matrix operations in VHDL you need the myPackage.vhd file.
I created a test bench to recieve the inputs and calculate the desired output.
For outputs I created a matlab code to produce the inputs.
For the simulation file you need to have the tcl file that I uploaded.
